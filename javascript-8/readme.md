# 8. Your task is to create a webpage that displays the time in hours, minutes, and seconds in the center of the screen. Format the time to have 2 digits for hours, minutes, and seconds, and use the time's values to assign a hex code to the background. The timer should update in real-time without any user interaction. For Example: If the time is 12:10:50 the background color of the webpage will have the hex code “#121050”.
